# GettingCleaningData
Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repository contains the script run_analysis.R which takes data from the UCI HAR dataset and creates two tidy datasets, exported to text files:  MeanStOnly.txt and BySubject.txt

Explanation of how the script works is contained within the comments of the script itself.

MeanStOnly.txt contains a fully labeled version of the combined UCI HAR test and train datasets.

BySubject.txt contains the mean of the data of the MeanStOnly.txt dataset grouped by Subject and Activity.

CodeBook.md contains a further explanation of the variables contained in MeanStOnly and BySubject.
